      <h1>Survey Explanation</h1>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to fill in this survey to help
      us with our course, Methods in AI research. </p>
      <p> We need to test a restaurant recommendation system we developed for this course. </p>
      <p> This Restaurant Recommendation System works in a fake town with a lot of restaurants, with restaurants in the north, south, west, east, and center. Food type ranges widely, for example thai, french, or chinese food. The pricing can be cheap, moderate or expensive.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Below, you'll find two links leading to two recommender
      systems that work slightly differently. </p>
      <p>Please follow the first link and complete the test, and when you have found the restaurant, please continue on to fill in the survey! </p> 
      <p>Then follow the second link to complete the second test and survey.  </p>
