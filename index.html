      <h1>Survey Explanation</h1>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to fill in this survey to help
      us with our course, Methods in AI research. </p>
      <p> We need your help to test a restaurant recommendation system we developed for this course. </p>
      <p> The restaurant recommendation system works in a town with restaurants in the north, south, west, east, and center. Food type ranges widely and pricing can be cheap, moderate or expensive.</p>
      <p> Below, you'll find two links leading to two recommender
      systems that work slightly differently. </p>
      <p>Please follow the first link and complete the test, and when you have found the restaurant, please continue on to fill in the survey! </p> 
      <p>Then follow the second link to complete the second test and survey.  </p>
